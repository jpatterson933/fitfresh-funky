# Known Issues/Errors

There are serveral known issues. 

1. The application does not save the users workouts. Actually, it saves the workouts however, it does not display when the stats page is loaded. This causes problems since I am not able to actually show that the two routes with range, name are in actual descending order for the homework. 

2.  When adding a new workout, for some reason, the page reloads and you lose any information that has been added. I honestly have no clue why the issue exists.
